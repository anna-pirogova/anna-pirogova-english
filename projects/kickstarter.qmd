# 1. Project Overview

<img src="/images/kickstarter-thumb.png" width="50%">

The goal of the project is to investigate the factors influencing the success of projects hosted on the Kickstarter platform. The focus is on categorical variables, launch time, and project name characteristics. A classification decision tree model was constructed using the rpart() function, which predicts project success.

# 2. Data Preprocessing

The following steps were performed as part of data preparation:

- Converting string variables to factors for statistical tests.
- Converting the launch date (`launched`) to Date format.
- Creating new features:
- Based on launch date: month, day, season, day of the week, launch hour, part of the day, campaign duration;
- Based on categories: combined variable `gen_category`, string lengths, word count, first letters, and name matches;
- Based on project name: name length, word count, presence of CAPS and special characters.

# 3. Exploratory Analysis

## 3.1 Most Expensive Successful Projects by Category

The highest average revenue was collected in the following categories:
- **Technology**
- **Design**
- **Food**

## 3.2 Percentage of Successful Projects by Category

Most Successful Categories:
- **Comics**
- **Dance**
- **Theater**
- **Games**
- **Music**

Interestingly, the most expensive categories (e.g., Technology) show the lowest success rate (~25%).

## 3.3 Subcategories (gen_category)

Analysis by subcategory revealed:
- Higher revenue in specific subcategories (e.g., *Movie Theaters*, *Camera Equipment*).
- A more precise understanding of success—for example, *Video Games* lower the average success in the *Games* category, while *Tabletop Games* increase it.

## 3.4 Statistical Tests

A test of independence was conducted between success and:
- `category`
- `main_category`
- `gen_category`

In all cases, **p-value < 0.05**, the hypothesis of significant differences is confirmed.

# 4. The Impact of Launch Date and Time

### 4.1 Month and Day

Tests show statistically significant, but practically **insignificant**, differences.

### 4.2 Season and Day of the Week

- A slight increase in success in the fall.
- Projects launched **Tuesday–Wednesday** have the greatest success.

### 4.3 Time of Day

Projects launched in the afternoon (12:00–18:00) demonstrate better results.

### 4.4 Campaign Duration

- Projects lasting more than 30 days are less successful.
- Successful projects are, on average, shorter than unsuccessful ones.

# 5. Project Title as a Source of Indicators

The analysis showed that successful projects more often have:
- Longer titles
- More words
- All caps in certain words
- Special characters (":", "!", ";")

All variables were confirmed to be significant by statistical tests.

# 6. Model Construction

## 6.1 Complex Model (rpart, without feature selection)

- Accuracy on training set: **0.70**
- Accuracy on test set: **0.68**
- Tree pruning based on optimal `cp` was applied – accuracy remained virtually unchanged.

The most important variables are:
- `category`, `gen_category`, `main_category`
- `cat_first_letter`, `gen_cat_first_letter`
- `usd_goal_real`, `period_length`, `name_length`
- `launch_dayPart`, `currency`, `country`, `launch_hour`

## 6.2 Simplified Model

A model with a smaller number of features was built based on the variable importance from Model 1:

- Accuracy on the training set: **0.675**
- Accuracy on the testing set: **0.669**

**The decrease in accuracy is minor**, but the model is simpler and easier to interpret.

## 6.3 Interpretation of Groups

The simplified model identifies seven groups of projects with different probabilities of success:

1. Unfavorable subcategories → unsuccessful
2. Favorable subcategories → successful
3. High goal (>$31,000) → unsuccessful
4. Long campaign (>56 days) → unsuccessful
5. Low goal (<$1,418) → successful
6. Evening/night launch → unsuccessful
7. Daytime launch + moderate goal → successful

# 7. Tested hypotheses

In all cases, the hypotheses **regarding statistically significant differences** between success and variables (categories, dates, titles, duration, etc.) **were confirmed** (p-value < 0.05).

# 8. General Conclusions

- Categorical features (especially `gen_category`) are powerful predictors of success.
- The project name and launch characteristics (time, duration) also have an impact.
- A simple model can effectively predict success with reasonable accuracy.
- Exploratory analysis allowed us to justify the choice of variables for the model.

# 9. Recommendations

- When launching a project, consider the following: **subcategory**, **time of day**, **optimal campaign duration**.
- The project name should be **informative, long, and possibly with bolding (CAPS, symbols)**.
- Selecting the right subcategory is **key** to success..
