## Methods and Features

- **SQL queries** to the database + preprocessing in R
- **Visualization** of distributions by gender, age, position, and salary
- **Logistic regression** with SMOTE for class balancing
- **Model evaluation**: accuracy 0.81, sensitivity 0.82
- **Model interpretation** using Odds Ratio and the influence of factors
- **Simulations**: the impact of reducing overtime and increasing satisfaction

## Conclusions

The main factors increasing the risk of leaving:
- overtime (`OverTime = Yes`)
- frequent Business trips
- dissatisfaction with work conditions and relationships
- low engagement

Factors that reduce the risk of attrition:
- high engagement
- high job satisfaction
- doctoral degree

Specific measures were proposed: workload optimization, increasing engagement and the environment, the simulation of which reduced the predicted attrition by **22.4%**.
