## Project summary

![](../images/comics-thumb.png)

This project used data from the Good Reads website, user ratings for comics, and comic characteristics.

The comic recommendation system is based on two approaches: **collaborative filtering** and **content-based recommendations**. The project included **data preprocessing**, **sentiment analysis of descriptions**, and **network analysis**.

## Methods and Features

- **Collaborative Filtering (UBCF)**: based on the user-item matrix and RMSE score.
- Content-based Recommendations: used features such as publisher, genres (shelves), and average sentiment.
- **Network Analysis**: visualization of relationships between comics (later abandoned as irrelevant for recommendations).
- **Results evaluation**: both RMSE/MAE and manual (using test users) validation of recommendations was performed (by comparing the characteristics of comics liked and recommended to the user).

## Key Features

- Preprocessing: adding test users and ratings, cleaning the data
- Sentiment analysis: descriptions were broken down into words, and the average sentiment for each comic was calculated
- Content-based: a similarity matrix between comics was constructed based on the selected features

## Conclusions
- The results of the network analysis showed that it was not useful for recommendation, so it was decided not to use it.
- A formal evaluation of collaborative filtering showed that the model built using the UBCF method performed better than the IBCF, as it had lower RMSE, MSE, and MAE values. Therefore, we used it to create the function. - By comparing the characteristics (validation) of comics that users liked and those recommended by the content-based system, we concluded that the content-based system worked well.
- Based on internal user ratings, the content-based system performed better in recommending comics than the collaborative filtering: the publisher names and user-generated shelves were the same as those that the user rated highly.
